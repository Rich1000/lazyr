This package contains a collection of short functions that I find useful when analysing data. Many of them are simply short-cuts to existing functions in base R and are intended as a keyboard shortcut only. Others I have collected from places like Stack Overflow where someone has found a neat solution to a common problem - where this is the case I have cited the original author and provided a link to the original question.

This is a new package and doubtless contains many bugs - suggestions for improvements are very welcome!
